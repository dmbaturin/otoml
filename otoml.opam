synopsis: "TOML parsing, manipulation, and pretty-printing library (1.0.0-compliant)"
description: """
OTOML is a library for parsing, manipulating, and pretty-printing TOML files.

* Fully 1.0.0-compliant.
* No extra dependencies: default implementation uses native numbers and represents dates as strings.
* Provides a functor for building alternative implementations: plug your own bignum and calendar libraries if required.
* Informative parse error reporting.
* Pretty-printer offers flexible indentation options.
